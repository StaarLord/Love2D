## How objects are constructed in P-Mug:
Objects in PMug are made in a complex way that makes it easier to handler touch&mouse event.

Objects are consisted of 4 different classes:
- Shapes: They are like blocks to construct the building (The object).
- Handlers: They are responsible for handling the mouse, touch and keyboard events.
- Actions: Those are called by handlers, and they do the specific things objects have to do, like calling onClick function, or dragging the objects like in frames.
- Drawers: Those are responsible for drawing shapes, with custom styling applied.
